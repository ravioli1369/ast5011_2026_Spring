A good resource to learn Linux. it seems to cover nearly everything you'll need on a day to day basis. should be useful for newcomers and those already somewhat familiar.

Git/Github tutorial slides

Miniconda - utility to manage python environments and have different versions of python+dependencies installed in parallel

https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

pip venv - pip version of the same environment sandboxing

A general rule of thumb when using a conda environments is to try and install all packages using conda install. The specific command can be found just by googling conda install package_name  and the first or second link will be an Anaconda link with the command. Only install using pip in a conda env if the package isn't available on conda, as mixing conda and pip has the tendency to break your environment.

A couple of youtube channels I find quite useful for Python/Linux related stuff.
